        My Mom is illegic to gluten and there for can no longer eat her favorite food the Cinnimon toast crunch bagel. So because of that we are making a gluten free bagel using our revelutionary lemonflour. Personally I have no idea how we managed to make flour out of lemon but it is pretty cool anyways. It taste nothing like lemon which grosses people out but that can't be helped. Anyways its a lemon flavored bagel with cinnimon and I have no idea why it exist.
