        This cherry pie is only partially made with cherry's the rest is a secret ingredent that begins with the letter L. It is ok but you know its fine. Really we had to make a fruity product without lemons so we decided to make a cherry pie. Sadly Cherries are an inferior fruit product and so we do not often sell them because nobody likes Cherries.
