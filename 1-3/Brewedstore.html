        This was the worst desition I have ever made! This story is worth so much to me as I dreamed to own my own coffee store however due to an excess amount of lemons we were never able to do well. Our store was built on an anchient lemon farm and now that we built this coffee store on top of the farm we have been cursed by the lemon gods. Thats my theory anyways. Since I've worked here my mouth has always been sour. It is a truly terrible curse. Please take this place off my hands because nobody will!
