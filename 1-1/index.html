        About me
    </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Kyle Musser, is was born in North Carolina and moved to Bay City Michigan when I was 5 years old. I'm interested in software engineering and I am a patient and hardworking individual. No matter the task I make it my best effort to give it my all. I work well with a team and alway try to carry my own weight. I like kayaking and hiking but I'm also interested in Video games and sound design.
