                Freedom
            </h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px;margin:0px 10px;letter-spacing:1px;word-spacing:1px;">
                Freedom is the most important thing in life. Free of thought, and worry. Free of stress, and anger. In freedom, one can truly find themself. In today's world freedom is limited, few have it and almost no one will ever be able to achieve it. The truth is freedom is frowned upon. The World tries to constrain you with ideals such as the "American Dream", and to work a good job, own a big house, and raise a loving family. I know this dream all too well as it was something my parents thought they could achieve; however, they never did. My parents had a good job, and a large home, but were unable to raise a loving family. I hated my parents, especially my father. If the "American Dream" is the opposite of freedom then I will choose freedom. I have always wanted to head for Alaska ever since I read The Call of the Wild. Jack London was a great author. After reading his works I decided to finally choose the freedom I so desired. I ran away from my home and headed west. To forge my own story, and to achieve my freedom. So from here on out my name is Alexander Supertramp, and I live by foot.

            <h2>
                Bonds
            </h2>
            <p style="font-size:20px;margin:0px 10px;letter-spacing:1px;word-spacing:1px;">
                Sometimes freedom seems too hard to achieve. Lack of funds can hurt your ability to break away from societal norms. As well as family and friends, people will pull you towards them, and refuse to let go. Breaking away from society is a greater challenge than the adventure before you. There will be people you need to leave behind, bills, and payments you must avoid. Things that beckon you to stick with humanity, that threaten you from leaving. You must break these bonds that tie you down. Ignore your debts, ignore your friends, and walk away from your life. This harrowing price is what it takes to be free in such an oppressive world. To find yourself you must be willing to lose everything that made you who you were. It is impossible to turn back once this is done, returning to society is as great a feat as leaving it. Once you have lost everything now you have nothing to lose. No further bonds tie you back and you can get lost in the wild.
