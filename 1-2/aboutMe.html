            My name is Kyle Musser and I am a student at Western High School in Auburn Michigan. I hope to school at Delta Collage and 
            possibly Saginaw Valley State University. I hope to achieve excellence at the collages listed so I can accomplish my goals and 
            help the less fortunate. My dream is to become a Software Engineer and in the future start my own company. I was born in 
            Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, but moved North towards Michigan when I was 5 years old. I have lived in michigan 
            for most of my life and enjoyed the freezing winters and burning summers this state presents. The state or Michigan presents a 
            variet of opertunities for growth. With a grand amount of outdoor activities and many good reasons to stay inside Michigan 
            creates many different personalities for its inhabities.
