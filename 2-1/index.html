        </h3>
        <p style="color:darkslategrey;fill:black;">
            My name is Kyle Musser, I am a student at Western High School and have been for many years. I looking at going into software engineering at Delta and eventually SVSU. I have been around computers for a long time and have always shown interest in how they operate. I do many things from Kayaking to playing video games. I am enthustastic and hard working as I lived on a farm for many years of my life. I'm good at manual labor and more technical labor as well.
